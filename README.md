## Why Build This?

When Animal Crossing New Horizons came out during the pandemic, I used a critterpedia tracking site to keep track of my collections data. The site had a draggable critterpedia menu that I thought would make for a really cool challenge after finishing initial CRUD operations for user town data. I also just LOVE Animal Crossing...
